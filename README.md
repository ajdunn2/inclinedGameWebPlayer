# Inclined: A Unity Game by Andrew Dunn 

## Genre:
Action puzzler / Ball roller.

## MENU STAGE
Control scheme:
Select a game to play by pressing the left/right or A/D keys.

# OBSTACLE COURSE

## Control scheme:
-	Players move a rolling ball around with WASD or Arrow keys.
-	(once collected) SPACE key will shield allowing the ball to move over RED squares.
-	(once collected) LEFT CLICK to shoot spikes from ball (helps with pushing the little ball around).
-	Esc key will Quit to Menu 

## Game mechanics:
The game is split into 3 modes, normal mode (orange), day mode (light blue/pink) and night mode (purple/dark blue). The modes can be activated by moving into objects scattered around the level. The player will only be able to traverse the stages by switching between the modes.

## Progress through the game:
Player will initially start off with no power-ups or abilities. There will be three paths to travel but only one will be able to be completed initially. The skills gained on each path will allow the traversal of the next. After getting to the end of the fist path you will be given the shield power-up which will be needed to access the second path (to the right). After getting to the end of the second path you will be given a ball that will allow you to access the third path (to the left) and make it to the end of the level.

## Win / lose conditions:
If the player falls below the platforms into the grid or is hit by a red block, they will be reset to the starting position but will still have any power-ups previously collected and the timer will continue.

The player will win the game by first collecting all the power-ups then making their way to the course complete sign. The main goal of the game is to constantly improving upon your time. The game will keep a record of the fastest time to beat.

#ENDLESS INCLINE (BONUS MODE)

## Control scheme:
-	Players control a ball rolling down an incline with AD or Left and right arrow keys.
-	W or Up Key speeds up the ball
-	S or Down Key slows down the ball
-	Esc key will Quit to Menu 

## Game mechanics:
The ball will continue to roll down the incline forever. Move the ball to avoid the RED block, which will restart the roll from the top. Rolling over a purple pad will launch the ball in the air. Going over the edge of the incline will also reset the game.

## Win / lose conditions:
You will never win this game it is endless. Your goal is to play this mode for as long as possible. The game will keep track of how long you have played this mode up the top of the screen.
